I. Lesson 1: The Journey of a Song - 2015/02/02 
  A. Songwriting
    - Every song needs to answer 3 questions
      * Who is talking?
      * To whom?
      * Why?
    - Ex: Donnie & Donna - Donna decides to leave Donnie. Donnie responds.
      * Donnie is talking
      * To Donna
      * To deliver a message from the platform of now
        - "I hate you"
        - "Look at what we've been!"
        - "I'm signing up for Match.com"
    - Songs express an idea; ideas come from everywhere
      * What is it that you want to talk about?
      * Listen to people's conversations to get ideas
      * Keep a file of song ideas
  B. Point of View: Answers 1) who is talking and 2) to whom
    - Spectrum: Most Objective (Facts)----Most Intimate (Feelings)
    - Third Person Narrative - storyteller (singer) + audience look to the situation/people involved; Most Objective (He + She); God Perspective
      * Ex: "He won't believe what she says"
    - First Person Narrative - singer + audience have an intimate relationship. Singer address self + third person (I + he/she) 
      * Ex: "Why won't she believe me?"
    - Second Person Narrative - singer addresses audience and third person (you + she/he)
      * Ex: "He won't believe anything you say."
    - Direct Address - singer addresses audience directly (I + you); Most Intimate
      * Ex: "I don't believe a word you've said."
    - When you have an idea, try the song from all of the perspectives
  C. Boxes: Your Development Engine
    - Producers job is to create a journey in the song (rising emotion/climax) by adding instruments, sounds rising in the song bridge --> chorus etc. Producers will do this regardless of the lyrics.
    - We want to make the lyrics match the producer's line
    - Let your ideas gain weight by thinking inside boxes A[_] -> B[__] -> C[___]
      * Each box much still fit inside the next one
      * The idea becomes most interesting approaching the biggest box.
      * Not every song/lyric needs to do this. But in songs that you want to the listener to pay attention to what you say, this is useful.
    - Gaining Weight Engine
      * Ex: Are you really happy to old person? 
        - A: Are you really happy? I'd just like to know.
        - B: Did you cheat on me? I'd just like to know
        - C: All I wanted was honesty. 
    - The Perspecive Engine: Past -> Present -> Future
      * Ex: Lonely but found love
        - A: When I was lonely; Looking for; Love, love, love
        - B: Now I've met you; I'm happy in; Love, love, love
        - C: We'll be this way forever; Love, love, love
    - You + I + We Engine:
      * Ex: You're Amazing; our love is amazing
        - A: You are amazing
        - B: I have been looking for so long...
        - C: We will always be together, when you're in my freezer o_o
  D. Six Best Friends - calling the friends
    - WWWWWH - Who, What, When, Where, Why, How?
    - First Box: 
        * When, when does this happen?
        * 
  E. Song Form
    - The boxes are simple a description of the way the idea moves
      * First Box could easily be 2 verses, pre-chorus, chorus
      * Second Box could be verse, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, again
      * Third Box could just be a two-line bridge
    - Song form is an /independent/ concept from the idea's movement
    - Generally a song is created in sections (originally out of convenience)
      * Verse: delivers the basic information of your song; give the fundamental feeling/platform from which the song evolves 
      * Chorus (literally many people singing together): states the central idea of the song
        - Should be fairly easy to sing
        - Typically does not change words
        - Moves to a different level and summarizes/or comments on the information delivered by the verses 
      * Bridge: connects song sections; also moves to a different level of information than the other sections
      * Pre-chorus: little bridge/link between the verse and chorus
  F. The Story of Bernice: Relationship of song sections to the central idea
    - Chorus should be the highlight of the song.
    - The other sections should be diminished with respect to the chorus. If there is a high point/note in the other sections, it probably lesses the significance of the chorus (and we don't want that).

II. Lesson 2: Stopping and Going - 2015/02/09
  A. Prosody: all elements work together to support the central message of the song; an appropriate relationship between the elements
    - If there is any rule to songwriting, it is Prosody.
    - Stability and instability - is an effective vehicle for expressing prosody
    - Characterize ideas as stable/unstable, but note that tone can change the characterization
      * Stable - like a fact; sarcasm (since it's a position of authority
      * Unstable - like something is missing
      * Ex: I'm grateful you're in my life - stable (change of tone + "but" can make it unstable)
      * Ex: I wish you were here - tone implies unstable.
  B. Stable v. Unstable
    - Body language, tone set stability/instability, but they are just manifestations of feelings
    - Anything can take one a different color if you change these aspects
  C. Five Compositional Elements: five tools that are used to create stability/instability
    - Number of lines
      * Even number of lines feels stable; creates balances
      * Odd number of lines feels unstable, creates a sense of longing
      * Ex: John Mayer - "Your body is a wonderland", first 2 choruses have it 3 times, but final chorus has it 4 times (ends stable).
      * Ex: Your Love's gonna take me away --> change 4 lines from 3 gives forward-moving instability.
