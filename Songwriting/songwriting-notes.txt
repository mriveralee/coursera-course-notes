I. Lesson 1: The Journey of a Song - 2015/02/02 
  A. Songwriting
    - Every song needs to answer 3 questions
      * Who is talking?
      * To whom?
      * Why?
    - Ex: Donnie & Donna - Donna decides to leave Donnie. Donnie responds.
      * Donnie is talking
      * To Donna
      * To deliver a message from the platform of now
        - "I hate you"
        - "Look at what we've been!"
        - "I'm signing up for Match.com"
    - Songs express an idea; ideas come from everywhere
      * What is it that you want to talk about?
      * Listen to people's conversations to get ideas
      * Keep a file of song ideas
  B. Point of View: Answers 1) who is talking and 2) to whom
    - Spectrum: Most Objective (Facts)----Most Intimate (Feelings)
    - Third Person Narrative - storyteller (singer) + audience look to the situation/people involved; Most Objective (He + She); God Perspective
      * Ex: "He won't believe what she says"
    - First Person Narrative - singer + audience have an intimate relationship. Singer address self + third person (I + he/she) 
      * Ex: "Why won't she believe me?"
    - Second Person Narrative - singer addresses audience and third person (you + she/he)
      * Ex: "He won't believe anything you say."
    - Direct Address - singer addresses audience directly (I + you); Most Intimate
      * Ex: "I don't believe a word you've said."
    - When you have an idea, try the song from all of the perspectives
  C. Boxes: Your Development Engine
    - Producers job is to create a journey in the song (rising emotion/climax) by adding instruments, sounds rising in the song bridge --> chorus etc. Producers will do this regardless of the lyrics.
    - We want to make the lyrics match the producer's line
    - Let your ideas gain weight by thinking inside boxes A[_] -> B[__] -> C[___]
      * Each box much still fit inside the next one
      * The idea becomes most interesting approaching the biggest box.
      * Not every song/lyric needs to do this. But in songs that you want to the listener to pay attention to what you say, this is useful.
    - Gaining Weight Engine
      * Ex: Are you really happy to old person? 
        - A: Are you really happy? I'd just like to know.
        - B: Did you cheat on me? I'd just like to know
        - C: All I wanted was honesty. 
    - The Perspecive Engine: Past -> Present -> Future
      * Ex: Lonely but found love
        - A: When I was lonely; Looking for; Love, love, love
        - B: Now I've met you; I'm happy in; Love, love, love
        - C: We'll be this way forever; Love, love, love
    - You + I + We Engine:
      * Ex: You're Amazing; our love is amazing
        - A: You are amazing
        - B: I have been looking for so long...
        - C: We will always be together, when you're in my freezer o_o
